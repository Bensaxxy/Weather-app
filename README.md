*   üìÖ **Daily & Hourly Forecasts**: Get detailed weather predictions for the coming days and hours.
*   üé§ **Voice Search**: Utilize speech-to-text functionality for quick and convenient location lookups.
*   üíñ **Favorite Locations**: Save frequently visited locations for instant access to their weather data.
*   üîÑ **Recent Searches**: Automatically keeps a history of your latest weather queries.
*   üìä **Location Comparison**: Compare weather conditions across multiple selected cities side-by-side.
*   üåì **Automatic Theme Switching**: Dynamic theme (light/dark) based on the time of day, enhancing visual comfort.
*   ‚öôÔ∏è **Next.js API Routes**: Backend proxy built with Node.js and TypeScript for efficient data fetching from external weather services.

## Getting Started

To get WeatherCast up and running on your local machine, follow these steps.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Bensaxxy/Weather-app.git
    cd Weather-app/my-project
    ```
2.  **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```
3.  **Run the Development Server**:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # or
    yarn dev
    ```
    ‚ú® The application will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Environment Variables
No specific environment variables are strictly required to run the application or its API routes, as it directly consumes public external APIs (Open-Meteo, Nominatim).

## Usage

Once the application is running, you can interact with it in several ways:

*   **Search for a Location**: Type a city name into the search bar at the top of the page and click "Search" or press Enter. The main display will update with the weather for that location.
*   **Voice Search**: Click the microphone icon in the search bar to activate voice input. Speak the desired location, and the app will process your command.
*   **Unit Preferences**: Click the "Units" button in the navigation bar to open a modal where you can customize temperature, wind speed, and precipitation units.
*   **Favorite Locations**:
    *   When searching, use the "‚òÖ" icon next to a suggestion to add it to your favorites.
    *   Click the "Favorites" dropdown to quickly select a saved location.
    *   Remove a favorite by clicking the "‚úï" button next to it in the Favorites dropdown.
*   **Compare Locations**:
    *   When searching, use the "+ Add" button next to a suggestion to add it to your comparison list.
    *   Click the "Comparing Locations" button to view a grid of all added locations and their key weather metrics.
    *   Remove a location from the comparison grid using the "‚úï" button.
*   **View Forecasts**: The main weather grid will show current conditions, detailed metrics, and a 7-day daily forecast. The right sidebar provides an hourly forecast, which can be filtered by day.

## Weather App API

### Overview
The Weather App API is a Next.js API Route, implemented in Node.js with TypeScript, designed to serve as a robust proxy for external weather and geocoding services. It aggregates data from the Open-Meteo API for comprehensive weather forecasts and Nominatim (OpenStreetMap) for reverse geocoding, providing a unified and processed weather data payload to the frontend.

### Features
- `Next.js API Routes`: Leverages Next.js's serverless function capabilities for efficient backend logic execution.
- `Axios`: Utilized for making synchronous and asynchronous HTTP requests to external weather and geocoding APIs.
- `TypeScript`: Ensures type-safe and maintainable code for API request handling and data processing.
- `Open-Meteo API Integration`: Fetches detailed current weather, hourly forecasts, and daily summaries.
- `Nominatim (OpenStreetMap) Integration`: Performs reverse geocoding to resolve geographic coordinates into human-readable city and country names.
- `Unit Conversion`: Dynamically adjusts weather data units (temperature, wind, precipitation) based on client preferences.

### Getting Started
Installation for the API route is part of the overall project setup described in the main `Installation` section.

### Environment Variables
No specific environment variables are required for the API route itself as it directly consumes public external APIs without requiring API keys.

### API Documentation
#### Base URL
The API is served directly from the Next.js application at the following base path:
`/api/weather`

#### Endpoints
#### GET /api/weather
Retrieves current weather conditions, a detailed hourly forecast, and a 7-day daily forecast for a specified geographic location.

**Request**:
Query parameters:
- `lat` (string, required): Latitude of the desired location.
- `lon` (string, required): Longitude of the desired location.
